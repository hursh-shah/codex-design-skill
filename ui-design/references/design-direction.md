# Design Direction Playbook

Use this guide to set a clear design direction before implementation.

## Direction spec template

Write 5-7 lines before coding:

1. Product goal and audience
2. Tone in 2-3 adjectives
3. Layout strategy
4. Typography approach
5. Color/surface strategy
6. Motion strategy
7. Signature differentiator

## Direction quality checks

Reject weak directions:

- "Clean and modern" without concrete visual choices
- Typography defaults without a rationale
- Palette choices without hierarchy intent
- Motion choices that are decorative but not communicative

Approve only directions that are specific enough to implement.

## Signature differentiator ideas

Choose one and make it intentional:

- Typographic hero treatment
- Distinctive grid/asymmetry system
- Custom card framing motif
- Visual depth system (layers, texture, light)
- Narrative transition pattern

Use one strong differentiator instead of many weak accents.
