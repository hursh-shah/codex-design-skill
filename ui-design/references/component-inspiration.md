# Targeted Component Inspiration

Use this reference only when specific components need external pattern support.

## When to use

Use targeted inspiration for:

- Navigation systems
- Hero sections
- Pricing layouts
- Dense dashboards
- Complex forms
- Data tables and visualizations

Skip inspiration if the component is straightforward and internal patterns already cover it.

## Capture protocol

1. Capture only the specific component references required.
2. Record concise notes:
- Information architecture
- Spacing rhythm
- Type hierarchy
- Interaction behavior
3. Map patterns into project conventions and tokens.
4. Change enough structure and styling to avoid 1:1 cloning.

## Synthesis rules

- Keep behavior patterns; rewrite visual language.
- Preserve accessibility and responsiveness.
- Prefer compatibility with existing component architecture.
- Drop novelty that harms clarity or performance.
